Next Steps: Building on Your Actuarial Inventory Report
Perfect—let's move fast and turn this solid current-state foundation into actionable momentum. Here's a phased plan tailored to your situation (heavy reserving focus, SAS/Akur8 legacy, hype from architect/consultants, and your expertise as the hands-on guide).
Phase 1: Refine Messaging for Management/CIO Deck (Immediate – Next 1-2 Weeks)
Make the deck undeniable by contrasting current pain with Databricks wins.
Suggested Slide Structure (build on your 3 charts):
Title: Actuarial Inventory – Current State & Modernization Opportunity
Inventory Overview (your 3 charts side-by-side or stacked)
Highlight: Reserving = 28% of assets, 65% simple/medium complexity, 24% unknown cadence → governance gaps + batch-heavy.
Key Pain Points (bullet + icons)
Fragmented tools (SAS extraction → R/Python → Akur8) → long cycles (up to 1 year for final models)
Manual iterations & metadata gaps → compliance/audit risk
Scalability limits on large claims triangles & stochastic simulations
Target State with Databricks Lakehouse (simple before/after table)
Aspect
Current State
Databricks Target State
Projected Benefit
Data Ingestion
SAS wrangling from Oracle/ClaimCenter
Delta Live Tables / Auto Loader
Automated, schema-aware, real-time capable
Model Development
7-12 month iterations in RStudio/Jupyter
Collaborative notebooks + distributed Spark training
Year → months for complex ensembles
Model Governance
Manual + 122 "Unknown" cadence
MLflow tracking + Unity Catalog lineage
Full auditability, close metadata gaps
Akur8 Integration
Standalone comparison
Register Akur8 outputs in MLflow Registry
Unified side-by-side comparison
Production Scoring
Batch R/Python → CSV/DB
Model serving endpoints + drift monitoring
Scalable, regulated deployment
ROI Snapshot
Quick wins: Migrate 65% simple assets in months
Strategic: Speed reserving/pricing cycles → faster rate filings, better risk decisions
Cost: Retire SAS licensing silos over time
Your Messaging Tone: Factual, actuarial-focused ("We need interpretability for regulatory audits—Databricks enables custom GLM/ensembles with SHAP + monitoring, not just AutoML black-box").
Phase 2: Propose & Lead Reserving POC (Next 4-6 Weeks)
Focus here—Reserving has the volume, complexity, and regulatory sensitivity to prove value.
POC Scope (Low-Risk, High-Impact):
Objective: Demonstrate end-to-end reserving flow modernization on sample claims triangles.
Steps:
Ingest raw data (mimic Oracle/ClaimCenter → Bronze Delta tables).
Build medallion layers (Silver cleaned/enriched, Gold triangles/features).
Baseline traditional chain-ladder/GLM in notebooks.
Advanced ensemble (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM hybrid) with distributed training.
Track experiments/version models in MLflow.
Register a sample Akur8 output → compare metrics/explainability.
Deploy batch scoring + set up Lakehouse Monitoring for drift.
Success Metrics:
Runtime reduction (e.g., full-dataset training vs. current sampling).
Full lineage via Unity Catalog.
Regulatory-ready artifacts (model cards, SHAP explanations).
Your Role: Volunteer to own hands-on delivery—"I'll lead the technical build to ensure actuarial rigor is preserved."
Phase 3: Counter Hype & Position Yourself
On AutoML/GUI push: "Great for prototyping simple assets, but reserving requires actuarial judgment—let's use AutoML as baseline, then refine with custom code + governance."
On Erwin/OMG: "Unity Catalog delivers dynamic, auto-discovered lineage—more modern than static ER diagrams."
