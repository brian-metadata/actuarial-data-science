Summary Report: Actuarial Inventory Follow-Up 

Prepared by: Brian Brewer 
Date: December 08, 2025 

Original Request 

Another follow-up request related to the current state of Actuarial. Please reach out to Viren and Kishore today and collect a list of all the Actuarial inventory of software assets they use for all their use cases and classify them accordingly. This should have been already gathered as part of the current state by Cognizant. If there are any gaps in what Cognizant gathered, reach out to Andrew Doodnaught/Dillon Garrett first and then as needed Robin. Thank you. 

What Was Done 

- Reviewed current-state artifacts (Actuarial_Inventory_Summary.xlsx, PAS Report Inventory – Actuarial.xlsx, Actuarial Summary.xlsx, Actuarial Data Source Documentation.xlsx, Current_state_understanding_Actuarial_Finance.pptx, ETL/BI inventory decks). 
- Classified assets by use case: Analytics, Modeling, Pricing, Reserving, Statistical Reporting, and BI/Reporting. 
- Identified major gaps in lineage, governance, external feed contracts, BI per-object lineage, and downstream consumer mappings. 
- Developed recommendations for modernization (rewrite vs. legacy mapping), DataOps rigor, and data assembly line/harness to migrate, refactor, and test actuarial data products.

Key Observations 

- Partial documentation: Some job/table lineage exists; attribute-level mappings largely missing. 
- Governance gaps: Limited stewardship, DQ rules, and SLA tracking—especially for external feeds. 
- Legacy complexity: Thousands of SAS jobs and BI objects; mapping everything would be unsustainable. 
- Modernization imperative: Cloud migration and paradigm shift necessitate new pipelines rather than legacy replication. 
 

Why Mapping Everything Is Unsustainable (Actuarial Reality) 

- Statistical drift & model evolution: Requirements change continuously; actuarial models must be recalibrated and validated iteratively. 
- Iterative, hands-on data science: Requirements emerge through experimentation; much logic resides in SAS/R/Python code, not schemas. 
- Platform & tool changes: Cloud-native paradigms (ACID/Time Travel, ELT, catalogs) render static legacy mappings obsolete. 
- Double technical debt risk: Replicating legacy flows in the cloud creates parallel maintenance and slows modernization. 
 

Level of Complexity of Gaps & Why They Likely Exist 

1) Heterogeneous Legacy Landscape: Multiple source systems (Claim Center, Policy Decisions, Workbench, Billing), diverse schemas, and bespoke scripts accumulated over years make uniform lineage difficult. 
2) Undocumented/Ad Hoc Logic: Business rules embedded in legacy SAS macros, R/Python notebooks, and Excel workflows were not consistently documented or versioned. 
3) External Feeds & Regulatory Submissions: AM Best, ISO, NCCI, Carfax/MVR and bureau processes involve manual handling, file drops, and episodic updates—hard to capture in a single lineage framework. 
4) BI Lineage Granularity: Cognos/Pentaho objects often lack per-object upstream mapping and L3 filter/transform details, complicating traceability. 
5) Human Knowledge Silos: Key context resides with SMEs; staff transitions and domain breadth leave coverage gaps. 
6) Tooling Limitations Historically: Prior platform constraints and absence of an enterprise catalog/governance layer undermined sustainable documentation. 
 

Recommended Approach: Data Assembly Line & Harness 

- Establish a cloud-native data assembly line: standardized ingestion, ELT transformation, automated DQ tests, and contract-driven gold datasets. 
- Build a harness for migration/refactor/test: CI/CD for data products, regression baselines, statistical validation suites, and repeatable experiment tracking. 
- Leverage platform capabilities: governance catalog + lineage, ACID tables with Time Travel, and feature stores for reusable, point-in-time-correct features. 
- Focus on new pipelines feeding new actuarial use cases; retire legacy flows progressively to avoid double technical debt. 
 

Benefits of Governance, Cataloging & Modern Tools (Actuarial Focus) 

- Faster onboarding & iteration via DataOps (CI/CD, automated tests, observability). 
- Repeatable experimentation with Time Travel and versioned datasets/models. 
- Improved compliance & explainability through unified catalog, lineage, RBAC/ABAC. 
- Consistency and speed with standardized wrangling and certified gold datasets. 
- Feature store accelerates modeling, ensures point-in-time correctness, and reduces drift risks. 
 

Next Steps 

1) Confirm missing inventories with Viren and Kishore; document owners and consumers. 
2) Prioritize 1–2 high-impact actuarial use cases (e.g., Auto renewal pricing, WC reserving) for modernization. 
3) Stand up platform capabilities (catalog/lineage, RBAC/ABAC, ACID/Time Travel, DataOps). 
4) Publish standardized datasets and feature store entries; instrument DQ and contracts. 
5) Cut over BI/reporting and retire legacy flows iteratively. 
 

Summary Statement 

Modernization is not a migration—it is a rewrite. Establishing data engineering rigor and a DataOps-driven assembly line, supported by governance, cataloging, ACID/Time Travel tables, standardized datasets, and feature stores, enables fast, reproducible actuarial modeling while avoiding double technical debt. Focus new pipelines on new use cases, and retire legacy flows progressively.

SME Confirmation 

Kishore confirmed: 

“Planned assessment was completed. Actuarial team wanted to capture lineage and not detailed transform. However, there is a gap on capturing transformations as they may be required for modeling. It is currently not an ongoing activity.” 

Shape 

Implications 

Lineage captured: High-level lineage (job → table → field) exists. 

Transformation gap: Detailed transformation logic is missing, which is critical for:  

Predictive modeling 

Feature engineering 

Regulatory reproducibility 

Not ongoing: Transformation documentation is not being maintained, meaning this gap will persist unless addressed strategically. 

Shape 

Why These Gaps Exist 

Historical focus on lineage for compliance, not full transformation capture. 

Legacy complexity: Thousands of SAS jobs with embedded business logic. 

Tooling limitations: No enterprise-wide governance or metadata framework in place. 

Knowledge silos: Transformation details often reside with SMEs and in code comments. 

Shape 

Strategic Impact 

Reverse-engineering transformations for modeling add significant effort and risk. 

Reinforces the need for:  

Modern pipelines with governance and DataOps rigor 

Feature stores and standardized datasets 

Assembly line approach for migration and refactoring
